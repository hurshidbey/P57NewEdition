# Supabase Configuration Fix - Permanent Solution

## Problem
The production site was showing "Supabase is required" error after deployments because the frontend build wasn't getting the required `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` environment variables.

## Root Cause
The production `.env` file on the server only contained backend variables (without VITE_ prefix) but not the frontend variables (with VITE_ prefix) that are needed during the build process.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added VITE_ Variables to Production .env
```bash
# Added to /opt/protokol57/.env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://bazptglwzqstppwlvmvb.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

### 2. Created Verified Build Script
Created `/opt/protokol57/build-production.sh` that:
- Loads environment variables from .env
- **Verifies** VITE_ variables are present before building
- Shows truncated values for confirmation
- Fails fast if variables are missing
- Only builds if verification passes

### 3. Updated Deployment Process
Modified `deploy.sh` to use the verified build script instead of `npm run build`.

## How It Works Now

1. **Environment Loading**: Script loads all variables from `.env`
2. **Verification**: Checks that required VITE_ variables exist
3. **Confirmation**: Shows truncated values to confirm they're loaded
4. **Build**: Only proceeds if verification passes
5. **Integration**: Build includes Supabase configuration in frontend

## Verification
- ✅ Build script verifies variables before building
- ✅ Supabase URL confirmed in built JavaScript files
- ✅ Application starts without errors
- ✅ Frontend can connect to Supabase

## Future Deployments
This fix ensures that:
- **VITE_ variables will never be lost** during deployments
- **Build will fail** if Supabase config is missing (instead of silently building without it)
- **Verification happens** before every build
- **No manual intervention** required

The Supabase configuration issue is now permanently resolved.
