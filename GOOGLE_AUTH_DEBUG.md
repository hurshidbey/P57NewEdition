# 🔍 Google Auth Progress Debugging Guide

## Problem
Multiple users logging in via Google Auth are sharing the same progress (seeing the same completed protocols).

## Debug Steps

### 1. Open the Application
Go to: http://localhost:5001 (or https://p57.birfoiz.uz in production)

### 2. Open Browser Developer Tools
- Press F12 or right-click → Inspect
- Go to the **Console** tab

### 3. Test with Different Google Accounts

#### For First User:
1. **Login with Google Account #1**
2. **Watch the Console** for debug messages like:
   ```
   🔍 [DEBUG] Loading progress for user: abc123-def456-ghi789 (user1@gmail.com)
   🔍 [DEBUG] Expected localStorage key: protokol57_progress_abc123-def456-ghi789
   🔍 [DEBUG] Found localStorage data: NO/YES
   ```

3. **Mark a Protocol as Completed** (click "O'rgandim" on any protocol)
4. **Watch for Save Messages**:
   ```
   🔍 [DEBUG] markProtocolCompleted - User: abc123-def456-ghi789, Protocol: 1, Score: 70
   🔍 [DEBUG] Saving progress to localStorage key: protokol57_progress_abc123-def456-ghi789
   ```

#### For Second User:
1. **Logout** from first account
2. **Login with Google Account #2** 
3. **Watch for Different User ID**:
   ```
   🔍 [DEBUG] Loading progress for user: xyz987-uvw654-rst321 (user2@gmail.com)
   🔍 [DEBUG] Expected localStorage key: protokol57_progress_xyz987-uvw654-rst321
   ```

### 4. Check localStorage in Browser
In the Console, run this command:
```javascript
// See all progress keys
Object.keys(localStorage).filter(key => key.includes('progress'))

// Check specific user's progress
localStorage.getItem('protokol57_progress_YOUR_USER_ID_HERE')
```

### 5. Look for These Issues:

#### ❌ **Issue 1: Same User ID for Different Users**
If you see the same user ID for different Google accounts:
```
User 1: 🔍 [DEBUG] Loading progress for user: abc123-same-id
User 2: 🔍 [DEBUG] Loading progress for user: abc123-same-id  ← PROBLEM!
```

#### ❌ **Issue 2: Shared localStorage Key**
If you see the same storage key being used:
```
🔍 [DEBUG] Expected localStorage key: protokol57_progress_abc123-same-id  ← PROBLEM!
```

#### ❌ **Issue 3: Legacy Shared Storage**
If you see an old shared progress key:
```javascript
localStorage.getItem('protokol57_progress')  // Should be null
```

#### ❌ **Issue 4: Server Returns Same Data**
If server returns same progress for different users:
```
🔍 [DEBUG] Server progress response for abc123: [protocol1, protocol2]
🔍 [DEBUG] Server progress response for xyz987: [protocol1, protocol2]  ← PROBLEM!
```

### 6. Expected Correct Behavior:

#### ✅ **Different User IDs**
```
User 1: 🔍 [DEBUG] Loading progress for user: abc123-def456-ghi789 (user1@gmail.com)
User 2: 🔍 [DEBUG] Loading progress for user: xyz987-uvw654-rst321 (user2@gmail.com)
```

#### ✅ **Different Storage Keys**
```
User 1: protokol57_progress_abc123-def456-ghi789
User 2: protokol57_progress_xyz987-uvw654-rst321
```

#### ✅ **Separate Progress Data**
- User 1 completes Protocol 1 → Only User 1 sees it
- User 2 completes Protocol 2 → Only User 2 sees it

## Report Findings

Please check the console logs and report:
1. **Are the user IDs different?** (most likely issue)
2. **Are the storage keys different?**
3. **Is there any old shared storage?**
4. **Does the server return different data?**

Based on these findings, I can provide the exact fix needed!
