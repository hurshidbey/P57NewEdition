# Button Hover States Fixed

## Issue
Navigation buttons in the header had `hover:text-accent` which made black text on black background (invisible).

## Fix Applied
Changed navigation buttons in `app-header.tsx`:
- From: `hover:text-accent` (black text)
- To: `hover:text-white` (white text)

This ensures proper contrast when hovering over navigation buttons that use the ghost variant (black background on hover).

## Other Buttons Checked
✅ **Onboarding section tabs** - Already had proper hover states
✅ **Login/Register form links** - Use `hover:text-gray-800` or are plain text links (working correctly)
✅ **Navigation footer buttons** - Use proper Button component variants

## Visual Result
- **Before**: Black text on black background (invisible)
- **After**: White text on black background (high contrast, readable)

All navigation buttons now have proper visibility on hover.
