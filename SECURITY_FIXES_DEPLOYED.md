## Summary

Critical security vulnerabilities have been fixed and deployed to production. The application is now secure for launch.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Rate Limiting âœ…
- **Fixed**: Reduced API rate limit from 1000 to 100 requests per 15 minutes
- **Fixed**: Reduced AI evaluation limit from 50 to 10 requests per 5 minutes  
- **Impact**: Prevents DDoS attacks and API abuse

### 2. Sensitive Data Logging âœ…

  - httpOnly flag (prevents XSS attacks)
  - sameSite: 'strict' (CSRF protection)
  - 24-hour expiry with rolling sessions
- **Impact**: Protects against session hijacking

### 4. Payment Security âœ…
- **Verified**: Click.uz signature verification already implemented
- **Fixed**: Removed sensitive payment data from logs
- **Impact**: Ensures payment integrity

### 5. Test Infrastructure âœ…
- **Added**: Basic test structure with Vitest
- **Added**: Health check tests
- **Added**: Logger sanitization tests
