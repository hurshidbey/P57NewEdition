# 100% Discount Coupon Feature Deployment Guide

## Overview
This feature allows users with 100% discount coupons to bypass payment gateways and get immediate premium access.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **Coupon Validation Endpoint** (`/api/coupons/validate`):
   - Added `isFullDiscount` flag when `finalAmount === 0`
   - File: `server/routes.ts:843`

2. **Click.uz Payment Handler** (`/api/click/create-transaction`):
   - Added logic to handle 100% discount scenario
   - Bypasses payment gateway when `finalAmount === 0`
   - Immediately upgrades user to premium tier
   - Records payment with `payment_method: 'coupon'`
   - File: `server/click-routes-v2.ts:136-234`

3. **Atmos Payment Handler** (`/api/atmos/create-transaction`):
   - Similar logic as Click.uz for 100% discount
   - File: `server/atmos-routes.ts:85-202`

4. **Database Migration**:
   - Added 'coupon' as valid payment method
   - File: `server/migrations/007_add_coupon_payment_method.sql`

### Frontend Changes

1. **Payment Page** (`client/src/pages/payment.tsx`):
   - Added `refreshAuth` to auth context usage
   - Added handling for `isFullDiscount` response
   - Shows success message and redirects on 100% discount
   - **NEW: Hides payment methods and shows "WOW! BEPUL PREMIUM!" button for 100% discounts**
   - File: `client/src/pages/payment.tsx:181-201, 374-404`

2. **Atmos Payment Page** (`client/src/pages/atmos-payment.tsx`):
   - Similar updates as Payment page
   - Sends userId and userEmail in request body
   - **NEW: Shows special UI for 100% discount with free premium button**
   - File: `client/src/pages/atmos-payment.tsx:199-213, 720-731`

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migration (CRITICAL - Do this first!)

Run this SQL directly on your production database:

```sql
-- Add 'coupon' as a valid payment method for 100% discount scenarios
ALTER TABLE public.payment_transactions 
DROP CONSTRAINT payment_transactions_payment_method_check;

ALTER TABLE public.payment_transactions 
ADD CONSTRAINT payment_transactions_payment_method_check 
CHECK (payment_method IN ('click', 'atmos', 'coupon'));

COMMENT ON COLUMN public.payment_transactions.payment_method IS 
'Payment method used: click (Click.uz), atmos (Atmosfera), coupon (100% discount coupon - no payment gateway)';
```

### 2. Deploy Code Changes

```bash
# Deploy to production
./deploy-production.sh
```

### 3. Testing

#### Create a 100% Discount Coupon:
1. Go to Admin Panel: https://app.p57.uz/admin
2. Navigate to Coupons section
3. Create new coupon:
   - Code: `TEST100`
   - Type: Percentage
   - Value: 100
   - Active: Yes

#### Test the Flow:
1. Create a new test account
2. Go to payment page
3. Enter coupon code `TEST100`
4. Click payment method (Click or Atmos)
5. Should see success message immediately
6. User should be upgraded to premium without payment redirect

## How It Works

1. **User applies 100% discount coupon**:
   - Frontend validates coupon
   - Shows 0 UZS as final price
   - **Payment method cards (Click/Atmos) are hidden**
   - **Shows special "WOW! BEPUL PREMIUM!" button instead**

2. **User clicks the free premium button**:
   - Frontend sends request to create transaction
   - Backend detects `finalAmount === 0`
   - Instead of creating payment URL:
     - Creates transaction with `payment_method: 'coupon'`
     - Marks transaction as completed
     - Upgrades user to premium tier
     - Records coupon usage
     - Returns `isFullDiscount: true`

3. **Frontend handles response**:
   - Shows success message
   - Refreshes auth context
   - Redirects to premium content

## Security Considerations

1. **Coupon Validation**: All validations happen server-side
2. **User Authentication**: Required for transaction creation
3. **Duplicate Prevention**: Users already with premium tier are rejected
4. **Audit Trail**: All free upgrades are logged with special payment method

## Monitoring

Look for these log entries:
- `"Processing 100% discount transaction"`
- `"User upgraded with 100% discount coupon"`
- Payment method: `"coupon"` or `"coupon_100_discount"`

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Remove the 100% discount coupons from admin panel
2. Revert code deployment
3. Database constraint can stay (doesn't affect existing functionality)
