# Payment Issue Report - suhrobgirgitton@gmail.com

## Summary
User `suhrobgirgitton@gmail.com` made payments through Click.uz but didn't receive premium access because they don't have an account in our system.

## Technical Details

### Root Cause
1. **No Account Created**: The user never created an account in our system (neither through email nor Google OAuth)
2. **Invalid User ID**: The system was using a fake ID format `google_suhrobgirgitton_gmail_com` instead of a real Supabase user ID
3. **Missing Validation**: The payment system allowed processing without proper authentication

### Payment Details
- **User Email**: suhrobgirgitton@gmail.com
- **Payment Method**: Click.uz
- **Transaction IDs**: 
  - 3195550118 (14,250 UZS with TEST99 coupon)
  - 3195552052 (14,250 UZS with TEST99 coupon)
- **Total Paid**: 28,500 UZS
- **Status**: Payment successful but service not delivered

### Fixes Applied
1. ✅ Fixed auth system to use real Supabase user IDs for all users
