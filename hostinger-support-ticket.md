# Support Ticket: Critical Network Connectivity Issue - Server srv852801

## Priority: URGENT - Production Website Down

### Server Information
- **Server ID**: srv852801
- **IP Address**: 69.62.126.73
- **Domains Affected**: p57.uz, app.p57.uz, srv852801.hstgr.cloud

### Problem Description
Our production server is experiencing complete network connectivity failure from external sources. All inbound connections (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS) are timing out, making our websites inaccessible to users.

### Symptoms
1. **SSH Access**: Connection timeout on port 22
   ```
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/protokol57_ed25519 root@69.62.126.73
   ssh: connect to host 69.62.126.73 port 22: Operation timed out
   ```

2. **HTTP/HTTPS Access**: All web traffic times out
   - https://p57.uz - Connection timeout
   - https://app.p57.uz - Connection timeout
   - Direct IP access (http://69.62.126.73) - Connection timeout

3. **Ping**: No response to ICMP packets
   ```
   ping 69.62.126.73
   Request timeout for icmp_seq
   ```

### What IS Working
- Server is running normally (confirmed via Hostinger browser terminal at 169.254.0.1)
- All services are active and healthy internally
- SSH service is running on port 22
- Docker containers are operational
- No configuration changes were made prior to the issue

### Troubleshooting Already Performed
1. ✅ Verified SSH service is running: `systemctl status ssh` shows active
2. ✅ Checked server has no local firewall rules: `iptables -L` shows ACCEPT all
3. ✅ Confirmed no fail2ban blocking: Service not installed
4. ✅ Verified services are listening on correct ports
5. ✅ Tested from multiple geographic locations - same timeout issue

### Suspected Cause
This appears to be a network-level block outside of our server's control, possibly:
- Datacenter firewall/routing issue
- DDoS protection falsely triggered
- Network ACL blocking our IP range

### Request for Action
Please urgently investigate:
1. Any datacenter-level firewall rules blocking traffic to 69.62.126.73
2. DDoS protection or rate limiting that may be affecting our server
3. Network routing issues in your infrastructure

### Business Impact
Our production e-commerce platform is completely inaccessible, resulting in:
- Lost revenue every minute of downtime
- Inability to process customer payments
- Damage to business reputation
